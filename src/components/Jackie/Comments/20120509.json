Jackie was kind and eventually wrote a note for our son. Back home, our son who was speechless to receive a note from his most beloved mentor. Thank you so much taking time out for a very devoted fan."

Unfortunately after you had moved on i realised that my iphone memory was full so i didnt get the photo! Am gutted! But got to meet one of my true heroes! Thank you Jackie, today has made my summer! One of the best moments of my life!"
