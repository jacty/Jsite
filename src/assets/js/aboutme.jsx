                <p className='intro'> As a language enthusiastic fan, I have been involved in teaching Chinese to individual learners during my prepartion of my teaching degree. I am fluent in both Chinese and English. Moreover,I am also learning my third language to help me understand and get different sense of language and teaching. I have a strong tendency to build interactive class which can strongly strengthen learners memory. Besides, as a freelancer in mutilcultural environment, my previous experience can help me share understandings with learners from different background. Wish I can bring a fabulous journey of Chinese study to you.</p>*/}
