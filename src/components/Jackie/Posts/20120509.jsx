                <p>
                  After a long long flight from Latvia, I finally arrived back in Hong Kong. As soon as I got off the plane, I went straight home and played with my two dogs, Jones and JJ. Then after taking a shower and having a little something to eat, I went back to the office because I had a few meetings to attend. I spent a couple of days doing some voice dubbing and then continued with more meetings.

                  Beautiful Cannes
                </h2>
                <p>
                  From Hong Kong I flew to Beijing and stayed for a couple of days because I had more meetings to attend. After I finished all my meetings, I packed my bags and prepared to fly to Cannes for the famous film festival, the 65th Cannes Film Festival. I’m actually quite excited because I’m going to be launching a new trailer for my movie, Chinese Zodiac. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I traveled together with some of the cast from Chinese Zodiac, including Yao Xingtong, Zhang Lanxin, Kwone Sang Woo, Liao Fan, and Steve Yoo. On the way while flying over the coast of France, I took some photos of beautiful Nice. Let me share a few photos with you.

                <p>Do you think this photo looks like a “tiny town”?</p>

                  This is the first time my two pandas, LA & ZY, visited Nice and Cannes, so of course I had to take a photo of them at the airport!

                We drove for about 45 minutes and arrived at the film festival destination, Cannes. It’s so beautiful here! And the people are so lovely! After checking into the hotel, I prepared to attend my first event of the trip, the Film China Night. I went along with Zhang Lanxin, Steve Yoo, Kwone Sang Woo and Liao Fan. My Seven Little Fortunes were in Cannes as well! They performed at the Film China Night opening ceremony, and then afterwards there was a very pretty fireworks display. Even LA & ZY enjoyed the fireworks!!

                  My Seven Little Fortunes had a really fun night.

                <p>
                I woke up the next morning and prepared for the busy schedule ahead. Actually, today’s schedule wasn’t too busy. I just had a few meetings, did a few interviews, and then walked the red carpet in the evening.

                I knew I had to get to sleep early tonight because the next day was a very important day for me and my new movie. After waking up in the morning, I took a quick shower and prepared to attend the press conference for the announcement of my new movie, Chinese Zodiac (CZ12). I went to the Carlton Hotel at 10:30am and met up the costars, Laura Weissbecker, Kwone Sang Woo, Yao Xing Tong, Zhang Lan Xin, Liao Fan, Steve Yoo, and my good friend Brett Ratner. Bret is the executive producer of my movie and I was so happy to see him.

                <p>
                I was very happy to see so many international press and media attending the event. I told everybody about CZ12 and I showed them this trailer. Have you seen it yet?

                After the press conference, we went outside for a photo call, and then after that, I gave lots of interviews to many different TV stations, press and media. I also saw a lot of fans outside the Carlton so of course I had to take a moment and say hi to them.

                In the evening, organizers arranged a CZ12 cocktail party for the launch of my new movie at the Majestic Beach. Before I attended the event, I took a photo of the beautiful clouds in the sky. Do you think it looks nice?

                <img className='img-broken' src={Broken} width='260' height='170' alt='img broken' title='img broken'/>                
                <p>
                The cocktail party was a great success! We had a brief ceremony at the beginning where I told everyone a little about the movie and how we filmed in many different countries including France, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vanuatu, Cairns and Latvia. I also briefly explained the significance behind CZ12 and the Chinese bronze heads. Did you know that the Ox bronze head was first auctioned in 2000 and sold for HKD$7 million. The Monkey and Tiger bronze was sold the same year for HKD$7.4 million and HKD$14 million respectively. Several years later, Stanley Ho bought the Pig bronze head as an investment and in 2007, he set a new record for the highest bidding price on an item at an auction, winning the Horse bronze for HKD$69.1 million. The Rat and Rabbit bronze heads combined sold for $31.49 million Euro in 2009. However, there is no news about the remaining Dragon, Snake, Ram, Rooster or Dog bronze heads.

                Cannes has been so great! I've seen many, many friends, new and old, and as always, my fans have been super enthusiastic and supportive! It's been a lot of fun, but exhausting, and now I'm heading back home to Hong Kong for a few days, then off to Beijing for more voice dubbing. Enjoy the trailer and let me know what you think!
